#Dictionary comprehension - Transforming one dictionary into another
#zip() -function in Python is a built-in utility that aggregates elements from multiple iterables into an iterator of tuples. It pairs corresponding elements from each input iterable based on their index. 
# keys = ['name','gender','status']
# values = ['anitah','Female','TBC']

# info = {k:v for (k,v) in zip(keys,values)}
# print(info)

# sq_num ={i:i**2 for i in range(1,10)}
# print(sq_num)
